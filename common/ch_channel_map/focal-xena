# These are charmhub mappings for charms that are outside of the main large
# groupings like openstack and ceph etc.

# Versions are based on https://docs.openstack.org/charm-guide/latest/project/charm-delivery.html

# Charm Delivery was changed to recommend OVN 22.03 for all OpenStack versions
# from Ussuri onwards, however many customers originally deployed on this older
# version. The older version is kept by default to make it more likely to
# replicate a customer issue but you should check and match the customer
# environment you are reproducing.
